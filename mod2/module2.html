   			<section>Egg</section>
   			<p>An average-sized egg contains about 6–7 grams of protein. To enable your body to use as much of that as possible, it is recommended to eat eggs cooked rather than raw. Aside from their impressive protein content, eggs are low in calories, high in nutrients and especially weight loss friendly.</p>
